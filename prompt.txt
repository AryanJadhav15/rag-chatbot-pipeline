I am providing you with some chucks which are all related to python Object Oriented Programming  chunks contain video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time (these are for only your reference and you should not give the chuks as ou):

[{"video_number":"73","video_name":"Magic\u29f8Dunder Methods in Python","start":683.16,"end":684.16,"text":" about some dunder methods"},{"video_number":"58","video_name":"Constructors in Python","start":228.56,"end":230.56,"text":" This is called the dunder method."},{"video_number":"73","video_name":"Magic\u29f8Dunder Methods in Python","start":0.0,"end":4.72,"text":" In today's video, we will talk about some magic methods, also known as Dunder Methods."},{"video_number":"77","video_name":"Operator Overloading in Python","start":8.0,"end":10.0,"text":" dunder methods which start with underscore underscore"},{"video_number":"73","video_name":"Magic\u29f8Dunder Methods in Python","start":53.12,"end":55.84,"text":" Now I will tell you about the len method, which is a dunder method."}]
---------------------------------
"what are dunder methods"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
