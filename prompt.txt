I am providing you with some chucks which are all related to python Object Oriented Programming  chunks contain video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time (these are for only your reference and you should not give the chuks as ou):

[{"video_number":"60","video_name":"Getters and Setters in Python","start":338.12,"end":340.12,"text":" what is getter and setter?"},{"video_number":"60","video_name":"Getters and Setters in Python","start":552.12,"end":554.12,"text":" what is getter and setter."},{"video_number":"60","video_name":"Getters and Setters in Python","start":62.64,"end":65.92,"text":" Now here you see what getters are and what setters are."},{"video_number":"60","video_name":"Getters and Setters in Python","start":331.12,"end":333.12,"text":" So this is the example of getter and setter."},{"video_number":"60","video_name":"Getters and Setters in Python","start":0.0,"end":2.48,"text":" In Python, you can make getters and setters."}]
---------------------------------
"What are getters and setters?"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
