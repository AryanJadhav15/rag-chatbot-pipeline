So, you're wondering about "dunder methods" - those special methods in Python that are used for various operations like length, equality, comparison, and more.

From what I've seen in the video chunks, it seems that dunder methods were discussed in two videos: "Magic Dunder Methods in Python" (Video 73) and "Operator Overloading in Python" (Video 77).

In Video 73, "Magic Dunder Methods in Python", the instructor talks about various magic methods like `__len__`, which returns the length of an object. They're also discussed how these methods are used to make objects more intuitive to use.

On the other hand, in Video 77, "Operator Overloading in Python", dunder methods are mentioned briefly as those that start with double underscores (like `_underscore_`).

To learn more about dunder methods and see examples of how they're used, I'd recommend watching Video 73: "Magic Dunder Methods in Python".
